# Readable-react-nanodegree
React-Redux application for Content and Comment Web App (Forums App). Users will be able to do the following:
    1. post content to predefined categories
    2. comment on their posts and other user's posts,
    3. vote on posts and comments.
    4. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This is a project for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server that I used to develop and interact with the front-end portion of the project.

## Start Developing
To get started developing right away:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, 
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm start`

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
